What is This?

A Matlab implementation of Democratic Co-Learning by Yan Zhou et. al.

------------------
How To Use?

Run demoMain.m to see a demonstration of the algorithm on the half-moon 2D dataset. Change isDebug flag to true in order to follow the inner working of the algorithm. democraticCo_train.m is for training and democraticCo_predict.m is for doing prediction over the learned models. Follow the comments in those scripts, they explain the code and inner working very well.

Add "Functions" folder to Matlab path before running.

------------------
Are There Any Restrictions?

This is used only for binary classification.
